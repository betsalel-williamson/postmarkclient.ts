# Embrace Functional & Immutable Patterns

**Rationale:** Promotes immutability, reduces side effects, and improves code readability.

**Rule:** Utilize immutable array operators like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` for data transformations instead of imperative `for` loops that mutate state.
**Rule:** All state updates must produce new objects or arrays. Never mutate data in place.
