## Task

Implement a mechanism to ensure that a one-time marketing email is sent to each lead only once. This is a critical business requirement to maintain a professional relationship with potential customers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A persistent storage layer (e.g., a new dbt model or a separate table) is created to track sent emails. This table should at a minimum store the lead's email address and a timestamp of when the email was sent.
- [ ] The dbt transformation logic is updated to flag leads that have already been contacted.
- [ ] The Dagster asset/op that sends emails is updated to filter out leads that have already been flagged as contacted.
- [ ] The system is tested to ensure that if the pipeline is run multiple times, it does not send duplicate emails to the same lead.
