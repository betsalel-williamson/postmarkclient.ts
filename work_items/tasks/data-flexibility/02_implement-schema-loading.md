## Task

Create a utility to load and parse the external schema file, making it available for validation and dynamic typing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new utility function (e.g., `loadSchema`) is created in `src/utils/schemaLoader.ts`.
- [ ] The `loadSchema` function can read a JSON Schema file from a given path.
- [ ] The `loadSchema` function parses the JSON content into a usable JavaScript object.
- [ ] Basic error handling is implemented for file not found or invalid JSON.
