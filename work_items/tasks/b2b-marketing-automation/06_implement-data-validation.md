## Task

Implement data validation and transformation logic for the data read from the database, including sophisticated extraction of product interest and consideration for customer-facing content.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A validation and transformation function is created in `src/utils/validation.ts`.
- [x] The function checks for character limits on `company`, and `title`.
- [x] The function extracts `product_interest` from multiple relevant fields (e.g., `title`, `email`, `company`, `products`, `notes`) and transforms it into the `product_interest` enum.
- [ ] The function includes logic for handling and transforming notes for potential customer-facing use, ensuring appropriate language and formatting. (Further definition required)
- [x] The `getLeads` function calls this validation and transformation function for each lead.
