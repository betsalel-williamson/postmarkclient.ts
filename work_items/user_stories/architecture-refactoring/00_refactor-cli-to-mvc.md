- **As a** Developer,
- **I want to** refactor the CLI application to follow an MVC pattern,
- **so that** I can improve maintainability, extensibility, and testability of the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The application's code is organized into distinct Model, View, and Controller layers.
- All console output is handled by the View layer.
- Business logic is encapsulated within the Model layer.
- CLI argument parsing and orchestration are handled by the Controller layer.
- Code coverage remains at or above current levels.
- All existing tests pass.

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: Codebase adheres to MVC principles, as evidenced by code review.
- **Secondary Metrics**: No decrease in test coverage; improved clarity of module responsibilities.
