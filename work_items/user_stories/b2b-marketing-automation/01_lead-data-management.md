- **As a** Marketing Operator,
- **I want** the application to manage a database of B2B leads,
- **so that** I can track customer information, avoid duplicates, and maintain a history of interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system must provide a mechanism to "upsert" lead data, updating existing leads based on email and creating new ones if they don't exist.
- The system must store all lead data points as specified in the requirements.
- The system must log every upsert operation to a submission history table.
- The system must validate incoming data against defined constraints (character limits, enums).

## Metrics for Success

- **Primary Metric**: 0 duplicate lead records created.
- **Secondary Metrics**:
  - Measure the time taken to process a batch of 1000 lead upserts.
  - Ensure 100% of data validation rules are enforced.
